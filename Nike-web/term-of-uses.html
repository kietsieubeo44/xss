            <br><br>

            PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY NIKE PLATFORM.
            <br><br>
            If you live in any of the following countries or regions, additional terms may apply to you and are viewable
            at
            the bottom of these Terms. We display the country/region within the Terms when applicable. These additional
            terms override the Terms below to the extent of any inconsistency.
            <br><br>
            Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Philippines, all European countries
            (including specific terms for Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland).
            <br><br>
            Welcome to the NIKE community! You are reading these Terms because you are using a NIKE website, digital
            experience, social media platform, mobile app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or
            services,
            all of which are part of NIKE’s Platform (“Platform”). You may access the Platform through a computer,
            mobile
            phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”. Your carrier's normal
            rates
            and fees apply to your Device.
            <br><br>
            These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and NIKE and its affiliates (which we may refer
            to as
            “NIKE,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform. Please review our List of Local Entities
            for
            the name of the NIKE entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact
            information. A few important points:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Our Terms May Change. Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer
                    terms, so this
                    paragraph may not apply to you. [See Canada terms.] We may update these Terms from time to time. If
                    a material
                    change is made, we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification. Read through any
                    changes, and
                    if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform. If you continue to use our Platform
                    after we notify
                    you of changes, you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent
                    prohibited by
                    applicable law.</li>
                <li>Terms of Sale. By making any purchase with us, you also agree to the Terms of Sale that apply in
                    your country or
                    region. [See Hungarian terms.]</li>
                <li>Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of personal information on the
                    Platform and
                    applies to your use of the Platform.</li>
                <li>Important Notice for Amateur Athletes. You are responsible for ensuring that your participation on
                    the Platform
                    does not affect your eligibility as an amateur athlete. Please check with your amateur athletic
                    association for
                    the rules that apply to you. NIKE is not responsible or liable for your use of the Platform
                    resulting in your
                    ineligibility as an amateur athlete.</li>
            </ul>



            1. GROUND RULES<br><br>

            Eligibility. You are only eligible to use the Platform if you are of legal age in your country/region or if
            you
            have consent from your parent or guardian. There may be certain age restrictions for specific Platform
            services
            in various countries or regions.<br><br>

            Rules for Registration. When you register for an account with us, the following rules apply:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Be True: Provide accurate and current registration information.</li>
                <li>Be You: Keep your registration personal. Do not register for more than one NIKE account, register a
                    NIKE account
                    on behalf of someone else, or transfer your account.</li>
                <li>Be Secure: Keep your username, password and other login credentials secure and do not allow anyone
                    else to use
                    your account.</li>
                <li>Be Responsible: Inform NIKE immediately of any unauthorized use of your NIKE account. You are
                    responsible for
                    anything that happens through your NIKE account – with or without your permission. TO THE MAXIMUM
                    EXTENT ALLOWED
                    BY APPLICABLE LAW, NIKE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR ACTIVITY THAT RESULTS FROM THE
                    UNAUTHORIZED USE OF
                    YOUR ACCOUNT.</li>
            </ul>
            2. OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT<br><br>

            Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform - including text, software,
            scripts,
            code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news
            stories, sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content ("Content") - is owned by NIKE or
            others we license Content from, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. NIKE
            reserves
            all rights not expressly described in these Terms.<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the NIKE name and the Swoosh design) are owned,
                    registered
                    and/or licensed by NIKE. You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks,
                    service marks,
                    or trade names through your access or use of the Platform or Content.</li>
                <li>You agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from materials downloaded or printed from
                    the Platform.
                    To the extent NIKE approves the download or use of Content comprised of copyrights or copyrightable
                    works, NIKE
                    grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access
                    and use
                    such copyrights or copyrightable works solely for their intended purpose and solely for as long as
                    NIKE makes
                    such Content generally available to the public. You do not acquire any ownership rights in the
                    Content
                    (including any trademarks or other intellectual property included in the Content), and all such
                    Content is
                    intended for personal, non-commercial use. NIKE reserves the right to monitor your use and to alter
                    or revoke
                    this license or your access to the Content at any time and for any reason. NIKE reserves the right
                    to take down
                    any Content in violation of these terms or NIKE’s intellectual property rights. NIKE allowing you
                    this limited
                    use does not constitute a waiver of any of Nike’s rights to the Content.</li>
                <li> Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by NIKE in connection with the Platform, you
                    agree not to
                    use, copy, edit, translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works
                    of, or in any
                    way exploit any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally
                    post on the
                    Platform), without NIKE’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a
                    breach of
                    copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may subject you to criminal or civil
                    charges and
                    penalties.</li>
            </ul>
            3. POSTING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM<br><br>

            User Content License. Some parts of the Platform allow you to post photos, videos, comments, and other
            content,
            which we refer to as “User Content.” Nike is not responsible for User Content others post to the Platform.
            User
            Content is owned by you or whoever created it, but when you post User Content you license it to NIKE as
            described below:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>You represent that you have the right to post your User Content, and you grant NIKE a non-exclusive,
                    perpetual,
                    transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any of the User Content that
                    you post on or
                    in connection with the Platform, including the likeness of any person that appears in the User
                    Content, or any
                    of the concepts or ideas contained in the User Content, for any purpose, including commercial use,
                    which
                    includes the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, sublicense,
                    distribute and
                    assign these rights. NIKE may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any time. [See
                    Argentina,
                    Colombia, Belgium, and Philippines terms.]</li>
                <li>You understand that deleted User Content may persist in NIKE’s systems and on the Platform to the
                    extent your
                    User Content has been publicly posted or shared with others who have not deleted it, unless you or
                    the relevant
                    individual request deletion or blocking of personal data in accordance with applicable law.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            LICENSE TO USE COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND IDEAS. You understand that any comments, feedback, or ideas you send
            us
            are provided on a non-confidential basis and you grant to NIKE a perpetual, worldwide license to use all
            comments, feedback and ideas you may share with us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you,
            for
            any purposes whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and
            services and creating, modifying or improving products and services. [See Colombia and Belgium
            terms.]<br><br>

            4. USER CODE OF CONDUCT<br>
            We’re excited to have you contribute to the NIKE community. Here are a few basic rules:<br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Be Original. Only post User Content to the Platform if you have all permissions and rights needed to
                    make that
                    User Content available, including from any individuals who appear or are mentioned in your User
                    Content.</li>
                <li>Be Safe.</li>
                <li>Do not do anything that may expose NIKE or its users to any type of harm, including anything that
                    may disrupt,
                    damage, disable, tamper with, overburden or limit the functionality of the Platform.</li>
                <li>Do not post User Content that contains software viruses, programs or other computer code, and do not
                    circumvent
                    or modify any Platform software or security technology.</li>
                <li>Do not use any data mining, robots, scraping or similar data gathering methods.</li>
                <li>Unless we indicate otherwise, our Platform is a public place. Do not post personal information to
                    the Platform -
                    yours or anybody else’s.</li>
                <li>Be Personal.</li>
                <li>Do not post any advertising, solicitation or commercial content on the Platform or accept payment
                    from a third
                    party in exchange for performing commercial activity on the Platform.</li>
                <li>Do not collect or solicit personal information from other Platform users or send unsolicited

                    illegal, misleading, malicious, harassing, inaccurate, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable or
                    inappropriate or which violates any applicable laws. NIKE has the right to prescreen, monitor, or
                    remove User
                    Content – but we have no obligation to do so.</li>
                <li>Be Yourself. Do not impersonate any person or organization, including athletes or NIKE employees.
                    HAVE FUN!</li>
            </ul>

            6. PARTNERS ON THE PLATFORM<br><br>

            From time to time, NIKE may link to or partner with third-party websites, social media platforms, mobile
            apps,
            and other products and services (“Third Parties”). You may be able to connect with these Third Parties
            through
            the Platform, but this does not mean NIKE endorses, monitors or has any control over these Third Parties or
            their activities, which are subject to separate terms of use and privacy policies. You should carefully
            review
            any Third Party’s sites and terms of use and privacy policy. NIKE is not responsible for the content,
            policies,
            or activities of Third Parties and you interact with Third Parties at your own risk.<br><br>

            7. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERSPHYSICAL ACTIVITY. 
            may
            not apply to you.] <br> The Platform may include features that promote physical activity, nutrition or general
            wellness. They are for your informational purposes only and are not intended as medical advice or services,
            or
            for diagnostic or treatment purposes.<br><br>

            Consider the risks involved and consult with your medical professional before engaging in any physical
            activity.<br>
            Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have viewed on
            the
            Platform.<br>
            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NIKE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY INJURIES OR
            DAMAGES<br>
            YOU MAY SUSTAIN THAT RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE FEATURES ON THE PLATFORM.<br>
            USER INTERACTIONS. To the extent allowed by applicable law, we are not responsible for your interactions
            with
            other users of the Platform or any damage or harm you may experience because of these interactions. [See
            Italy<br>

            Germany terms.]<br><br>

            terminated, subject to your right to have your User Content removed upon request in accordance with
            applicable
            law.
            These Terms remain in effect even after your account is terminated or you have stopped using the Platform.
            9. INDEMNIFICATION / LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br><br>

            We want you to enjoy our Platform, but NIKE must also protect itself from any damages you may cause.<br><br>

            Indemnification and RELEASE. Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on
            liabilities,
            legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions limitations may not apply to you. [See Canada, France,
            Germany and Hong Kong terms.] You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NIKE Inc., its affiliates,
            officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers (the “NIKE Parties”) from and against all

            claims
            or causes of action you may have for damages relating in any way to your use of the Platform.<br><br>

            LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on liabilities,
            legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions/limitations may not apply to you. [See Canada, France,
            Germany, Hong Kong and Philippines terms.] <br>NONE OF THE NIKE PARTIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL,
            INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST
            DATA,<br>
            THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS
            PURCHASED<br>
            THROUGH THE PLATFORM OR THE CONDUCT OF OTHER PLATFORM USERS (WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE), OR ATTENDANCE AT A
            NIKE<br>
            EVENT OR NIKE PARTNER EVENTS, OR ANY USER CONTENT OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE
            PLATFORM, EVEN IF NIKE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY
            FOR<br>
            YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM. YOUR ONLY REMEDY AGAINST NIKE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE

            DAMAGE<br>
            OR LOSS WHICH IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT, NIKE'S LIABILITY SHALL
            NOT<br>
            EXCEED US$100.00 OR EURO 100.00 IF YOU LIVE IN EUROPE.<br><br>

            10. DISPUTES / ADDITIONAL TERMS<br><br>

            Choice of Law/Jurisdiction<br><br>

            If you live in any of the following countries/regions, different “Choice of Law/Jurisdiction” terms may
            apply to
            you: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Switzerland
            and
            all other European countries.<br><br>

            You agree that this Platform is a passive platform solely based in Oregon, USA, which does not give rise to
            personal jurisdiction over NIKE in jurisdictions other than Oregon.
            You agree that the Platform, Terms, Privacy Policy and any dispute between you and NIKE shall be governed in
            all
            respects by Oregon law, without regard to choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on
            Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
            Except where prohibited by applicable law, and without limitation to any statutory rights for consumers, you
            agree that all disputes, claims and legal proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
            the
            Platform (including but not limited to the purchase of NIKE products) shall be resolved individually,
            without
            resort to any form of class action, and exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Multnomah
            County,
            Oregon, USA.
            You consent to waive all defenses of “lack of personal jurisdiction” and “inconvenient forum” with respect
            to
            venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Multnomah County, Oregon.
            All claims shall be brought within one (1) year after the claim arises, except to the extent a longer period
            is
            required by applicable law.
            Electronic Communications<br><br>

            By using the Platform, you agree to receive certain electronic communications from NIKE, subject to
            applicable
            law.
            You agree that any notice, agreement, disclosure or other communication that NIKE sends you electronically
            will
            satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.
            Right to Assign, No Waivers, Severability<br><br>

            NIKE may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you,
            unless
            notice to you is required by applicable law, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under
            these
            Terms.
            NIKE’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of these Terms is not a waiver of any of these
            Terms
            or NIKE’s rights. Users should always assume these Terms apply.
            If any provision in these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms shall
            continue to
            be enforceable.
