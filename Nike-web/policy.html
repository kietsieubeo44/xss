        <span>
        The Nike entity responsible for the processing of your personal data will depend on how you interact with
        Nike’s Platform and where you are located in the world. The relevant Nike entity are referred to as
        “<b>Nike</b>”,
        “<b>our</b>”, “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>” in this privacy policy. <br>
        Please review our <a href="#">List of Local Entities</a> for the name of the Nike entity responsible and the
        appropriate
        contact information.
        </span>
        <h4>WHAT Personal Data Do We Collect and WHEN?</h4>
        <span>
        We ask you for certain personal data to provide you with the products or services you request. For example,
        when you make purchases, contact our consumer services, request to receive communications, create an
        account, participate in our events or contests, or use our Platform. Additionally, when you request specific
        services in store, we may ask you to login to provide services that are then associated with your account
        (e.g. size, fit, preferences). <br>
        This personal data includes your:
        <ul>
            <li>contact details including name, email, telephone number and shipping and billing address;</li>
            <li>login and account information, including screen name, password and unique user ID;</li>
            <li>personal details including gender, hometown, date of birth and purchase history;</li>
            <li>payment or credit card information;</li>
            <li>images, photos and videos;</li>
            <li>data on physical characteristics, including weight, height, and body measurements (such as estimated
                stride and shoe/foot measurements or apparel size);</li>
            <li>fitness activity data provided by you or generated through our Platform (time, duration, distance,
                location, calorie count, pace/stride); or</li>
            <li>personal preferences including your wish list as well as marketing and cookie preferences.</li>
        </ul>
        We collect additional personal data from you to enable particular features within our Platform. For example, we
        request access to your phone’s location data to log your run route, your contacts to allow you to interact with
        your friends, your calendar to schedule a training plan or your social network credentials to post content from
        our Platform to a social network. This personal data includes your:
        <ul>
            <li>movement data from your device’s accelerometer;</li>
            <li>photos, audio, contacts and calendar information;</li>
            <li>sensor data, including heart rate and (GPS) location data; or</li>
            <li>social network information, including credentials and any information from your public posts about Nike
                or your communications with us.</li>
        </ul>
        When interacting with our Platform, certain data is automatically collected from your device or web browser.
        More information about these practices is included in the “<b>Cookies and Pixel Tags</b>” section of this
        privacy
        policy below. This data includes:

        <ul>
            <li>Device IDs, call state, network access, storage information and battery information; and</li>
            <li>Cookies, IP addresses, referrer headers, data identifying your web browser and version, and web beacons,
                tags and interactions with our Platform.</li>
        </ul>
        </span>
        <h4>KIDS</h4>
        <span>
        We comply with local laws and do not allow children to register on our Platform when they are under the
        legal
        age limit of the country in which they reside. We will ask for parental consent for children participating
        in Nike experiences and events.
        </span>
        <h4>TOOLS to Manage What Personal Data We Collect</h4>
        <span>
        When using our Platform, we also provide in-time notice or obtain consent for certain practices. For
        example, we will obtain consent to use your location or send push notifications. We may obtain this consent
        through the Platform or using the standard permissions available on your device.<br><br>

        In many cases, your web browser or mobile device platform will provide additional tools to allow you to
        control when your device collects or shares particular categories of personal data. For example, your mobile
        device or web browser may offer tools to allow you to manage cookie usage or location sharing. We encourage
        you to familiarize yourself with and use the tools available on your devices.
        </span>
        <h4>WHY and HOW Do We Use Your Personal Data?</h4>

        <span>
        We use your personal data in the following ways:<br><br>

        <b>To Provide the Features of the Platform and Services You Request</b><br><br>
        When you use our Platform, we will use your personal data to provide the requested product or service. For
        example, if you make a purchase on Nike.com or participate in an event or promotion, we will use the contact
        information you give us to communicate with you about the purchase, event or promotion. If you contact our
        consumer services, we will use information about you, such as delivery or payment information, or the
        product you have purchased to help you resolve a problem or question.<br><br>

        If you use our Platform to track your fitness activity or physical characteristics, we will collect this
        personal data and store it so that you can review it in the Platform. Your fitness activity data may include
        data you enter about your activity or data collected by your device during your activity such as location
        data and movement data. We may use this activity data to calculate further information about your activity,
        such as distance run, or calories burned, so that the calculated information can be provided to you as part
        of the functionality of the Platform.<br><br>

        In many cases, to use particular features within our Platform you may need to provide Nike with additional
        data or additional consent to use particular data in a certain way. For example, to use the heart rate
        tracking features of our Platform, you may need to connect to a heart rate monitoring device. Similarly, to
        share content on social media, you may be required to provide your social media account credentials to sign
        in.<br><br>

        <b>To Communicate Information about our Products, Services, Events and for Other Promotional Purposes</b><br><br>
        When you consent, we will send you marketing communications and news concerning Nike’s products, services,
        events and other promotions that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out at any time after you have given
        your consent.<br><br>

        <i>Direct Marketing</i><br><br>
        If you are an existing customer of Nike (for example, if you have placed an order with us), we may use the
        contact details you provided to send you marketing communications about similar Nike products or services
        where permitted by applicable law (unless you have opted-out). In other cases, we ask for your consent to
        send you marketing information.<br><br>

        <i>Personalization</i><br><br>
        We may use the information that you provide to us as well as information from other Nike products or
        services - such as your use of Nike’s Platform, your visits to or purchases made in Nike stores, your
        participation in Nike events and contests - to personalize communications on products and services that may
        be interesting for you. In doing so, we may combine the information you provide to us with information that
        we create about your online activity, including internal insights and analysis.<br><br>

        <b>To Operate, Improve and Maintain our Business, Products and Services</b><br><br>
        We use the personal data you provide to us to operate our business. For example, when you make a purchase,
        we use that information for accounting, audits and other internal functions. We may use personal data about
        how you use our products and services to enhance your user experience and to help us diagnose technical and
        service problems and administer our Platform.<br><br>

        <b>To Protect Our or Others' Rights, Property or Safety</b><br><br>
        We may also use personal data about how you use our Platform to prevent, detect or investigate fraud, abuse,
        illegal use, violations of our Terms of Use, and to comply with court orders, governmental requests or
        applicable law.<br>

        <b>For General Research and Analysis Purposes</b><br><br>
        We use data about how our visitors use our Platform and services to understand customer behavior or
        preferences. For example, we may use information about how visitors to Nike.com search for and find products
        to better understand the best ways to organize and present product offerings in our storefront.<br>

        <b>Use (Processing) of Workout Info</b><br><br>
        As discussed above, Nike collects data about your fitness activity or your physical characteristics ,
        together, “Workout Info”, to provide our services on our Platform. Because of the personal nature of this
        data, we strive to provide you with clear information about how Workout Info will be used. As this data may
        be considered sensitive in certain jurisdictions, we take appropriate measures in protecting and using this
        data and, where required by applicable law or under Nike’s internal policies, will obtain your consent for
        use of your Workout Info. Click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more.<br><br>

        <b>Other Purposes</b><br><br>
        We may also use your personal data in other ways and will provide specific notice at the time of collection
        and obtain your consent where necessary.<br><br>

        <b>Legal Grounds</b><br><br>
        To process your personal data, we rely on certain legal grounds, depending on how you interact with our
        Platform.<br><br>

            <li>When you purchase Nike products from our Platform, we need your personal data to fulfill our contract
                with you. For example, we need your payment and contact details to deliver your order.</li>

                information about the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, our products, services, events and other
                promotional initiatives; to operate, improve and maintain our business, products and services; to
                protect our or others' rights, property or safety; and for general research and analysis purposes. When
                processing personal data for our legitimate interests, we take appropriate measures to ensure that the
                interests we pursue are balanced with your interests, rights and freedoms, which we are happy to explain
                upon request.</li>
            <li>We also process your personal data, to comply with a legal obligation, or to protect your vital
                interests.</li>

        <span>
            <b>Nike’s Sharing</b><br><br>
            Nike shares your personal data with:<br><br>

                    services
                    to us. We use such services to match information that we hold with personal data in their database
                    to
                    create custom audiences and tailor advertising to your interests on the Internet, including social
                    media, as permitted by applicable law. You may opt-out of personalized advertising and custom

                    by using the relevant settings in our Platform.</li>
                <li>To any other third party where you have provided your consent.</li>
            </ul>

            our
            business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, spin-off, dissolution or liquidation).
            <b>Your Sharing</b><br>

            for
            managing Nike’s social sharing to control what information you make available through Nike’s social
            features.
        </span>
        <h4>PROTECTION and MANAGEMENT of Your Personal Data</h4>
        <span>
            <b>Encryption & Security</b><br><br>
            We use a variety of technical and organizational security measures, including encryption and authentication
            tools, to maintain the safety of your personal data.<br><br>

            The personal data we collect (or process) in the context of our Platform will be stored in the USA and other
            countries. Some of the data recipients with whom Nike shares your personal data may be located in countries
            other than the country in which your personal data originally was collected. The laws in those countries may
            not provide the same level of data protection compared to the country in which you initially provided your
            data. Nevertheless, when we transfer your personal data to recipients in other countries, including the USA,
            we will protect that personal data as described in this privacy policy and in compliance with applicable
            law.<br><br>

            We use a variety of measures to ensure that your personal data receives adequate protection in accordance
            with data protection rules. Where personal data is transferred within Nike, we use an intragroup data
            transfer agreement.<br><br>

            <b>Retention of your Personal Data</b><br><br>
            Your personal information will be retained for as long as is necessary to carry out the purposes set out in
            this privacy policy (unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law). In general, this means
            that we will keep your personal data for as long as you keep your Nike account. For personal data related to
            product purchases, we retain this longer to comply with legal obligations (such as tax and sales laws and
            for warranty purposes). Click here to learn more for

            traffic and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Platform. There
            are generally three categories of cookies used on our Platform:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Functional:</b> These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always
                    enabled. These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Platform within a
                    single session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping bag and
                    checkout process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.</li>
                <li><b>Performance:</b> These cookies allow us to improve our Platform’s functionality by tracking
                    usage. In
                    some cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to
                    remember site preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored
                    recommendations and slow site performance.</li>
                <li><b>Social media and Advertising:</b> Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to
                    your
                    social networks and share content from our Platform through social media. Advertising cookies (of
                    third parties) collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within
                    and beyond our Platform. In some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data.
                    Refusing these cookies may result in seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not
                    being able to link effectively with Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing
                    you to share content on social media.</li>
            </ul>
            For a comprehensive and up-to-date summary of every third-party accessing your web browser (through Nike
            Platform or otherwise), we recommend installing a web browser plugin built for this purpose. You can also
            choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all
            cookies. You do this through your browser settings on each browser and device that you use. Each browser is
            a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If
            you turn cookies off, you may not have access to many features that make our Platform more efficient and
            some of our services will not function properly. There are also general resources for opting out of
            interest-based advertising available on the website of the Digital Advertising Alliance. <br><br>

            Similarly, you can adjust your advertising preferences on your mobile device at the device level. For
            example, to adjust your advertising preferences in iOS, visit Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad
            Tracking. To adjust your advertising preferences in Android, visit Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of
            interest-based ads.
